# Spam Email Detection Algorithm

## Overview
This project aims to detect potential spam emails using a Python algorithm. The algorithm iterates over CSV files from the Kaggle database, analyzing the content word by word to identify patterns indicative of spam.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Install the required dependencies:



## Usage
1. Ensure you have downloaded the necessary CSV files from Kaggle and placed them in the `data` directory.
2. Run the algorithm by executing the main Python script:



3. Follow the prompts to input the necessary information, such as the file paths of the CSV files.
4. Once the analysis is complete, the algorithm will output the detected potential spam emails.

## Algorithm Details
- The algorithm tokenizes each email into individual words.
- It utilizes various natural language processing techniques such as stemming, stop word removal, and frequency analysis.
- Statistical methods or machine learning models may be employed to improve the accuracy of spam detection.
- The algorithm iterates over the provided CSV files, extracting and analyzing email contents to determine potential spam.
